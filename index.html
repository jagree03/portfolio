                    Visualised Traffic Simulator with Complex Systems <em>(Nov 2023 - May 2024)</em>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This was my final year project at De Montfort University. It is made in Java utilising libraries such as JavaFX
                    for the user interface as well as a third party community library called JFXtras that essentially supports JavaFX.
                    A key component is the A* Pathfinding Algorithm which has been adapted from a 2D Adventure game to function with my system
                    that contains drivers with vehicles that have some basic behaviours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Driving from one starting position to an end goal.</li>
                        <li>Responding correctly to traffic light signals such as red, amber & green.</li>
                        <li>Stopping the vehicle if a hazard is detected on the road.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, the Environment Editor is a key part of the system, allowing users to construct custom scenarios and simulate traffic upon them,
                    scenarios can be saved to files which can be reloaded into the application for enhanced intuitiveness.

                    Module Selection Tool <em>(Mar 2023 - May 2023)</em>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This was a project at University when I was studying the Object-Oriented Development module, it is a GUI-based application that allows
                    transitioning students from their previous year to their final year to choose their final year modules as well as any optional modules that 
                    they can study. It is built with the JavaFX graphics library to form the general user-interface with many UI Controls such as Buttons, MenuBar's, TabPane's etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some other features include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Registration of a student profile capturing data such as name, course, e-mail and input date.</li>
                        <li>Selection of unique modules between 2 academic terms with module credits system managed via validation.</li>
                        <li>Ability to select reservation modules in case the student cannot be accepted into their final year chosen modules.</li>
                        <li>Ability to save student data to a file if the student wishes to complete the selection another time, they can reload the student data file back into the tool.</li>
                    </ul>

                    E-Commerce System Prototype <em>(Jan 2023 - Apr 2023)</em>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This was a project at University when I was studying the Agile Team Development module, focusing on making a prototype e-commerce system that sells basketball merchandise.
                    It is a system that concentrates more-so on the back-end management features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I collaborated with 3 other team members for the development of this project and
                    each team member was assigned a role to work on. The following roles include: Staff Management System, Customer Management System, Order Management System & Stock Management System.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was assigned the Order Management System where I implemented a simple frontend presentation layer with exposure to the ASP.NET framework and
                    implemented some back end functionality by implementing Order and OrderLine classes and methods. I also assisted with the development of the Customer Management System.
