                    Visualised Traffic Simulator with Complex Systems

                <p>
                    This was my final year project at De Montfort University. It is made in Java utilising libraries such as JavaFX
                    for the user interface as well as a third party community library called JFXtras that essentially supports JavaFX.
                    A key component is the A* Pathfinding Algorithm which has been adapted from a 2D Adventure game to function with my system
                    that contains drivers with vehicles that have some basic behaviours.

                    These include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Driving from one starting position to an end goal.</li>
                        <li>Responding correctly to traffic light signals such as red, amber & green.</li>
                        <li>Stopping the vehicle if a hazard is detected on the road.</li>
                    </ul>
